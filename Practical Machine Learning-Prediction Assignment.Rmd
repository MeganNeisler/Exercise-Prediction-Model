## Synopsis
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which participants conducted an exercise using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 

We are using data from a weight lifting excercises study in which participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways: "exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E)."

We aim to develop a model that can predict the appropriate activity quality (class A-E) (the “classe” variable in the training set) by processing data gathered from the accelerometers.

This report describes the following:

* Model selection and building
* Cross-validation
* Expected out of sample error
* Rationale for selections

The model will be be run on the test data to predict the outcome of 20 different test cases.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
